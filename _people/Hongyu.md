### Biography 

Sun Hongyu is currently enrolled in PhD studies in School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, of Nanyang Technological University (NTU), supervised by Dr Kyungtak Lim. He obtained the degree of Master of Natural Science in Physics, from University of Science and Technology of China.

### Research Interests 

Sun Hongyu is working on gyrokinetic modeling of impurity transport and its control in diverse plasma scenarios. The presence of impurities in magnetic confinement plasma is unavoidable due to plasma-wall interactions, byproducts, and external particle injections. Even at extremely low concentrations, impurities can significantly impact plasma performance, leading to radiative energy losses that may ultimately extinguish the burning plasma. The presence of high-Z impurities, in particular, exacerbates these losses due to their strong radiative cooling effects. Therefore, his project aims to understanding impurity transport mechanisms, developing strategies to ensure stable plasma operation and achieving sustained nuclear fusion.
