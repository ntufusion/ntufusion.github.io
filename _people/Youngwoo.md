### Biography
Dr. Youngwoo Cho is a research fellow in the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences at Nanyang Technological University. In 2020, he received his Ph. D in nuclear engineering from Seoul National University in Korea under the supervision of Prof. T.S. Hahm. He was a postdoctoral researcher at Korea Institute of Fusion Energy from 2020 to 2023. 
<!-- He published 6 articles on peer-reviewed journals such as Nuclear Fusion and Physics of Plasmas. -->

### Research Interests
Before joining the university, Dr. Cho’s main research topic was the analytic study on residual zonal flow and numerical study on turbulence and energetic particle physics using gyrokinetic code. As a research fellow in NTU, he focuses on the implication of machine learning on gyrokinetic simulation results to analyze the interaction between zonal flow and turbulence in tokamak plasma. He also has interests in the analytic study of saturation rule of turbulence spectrum in the presence of zonal flow.
