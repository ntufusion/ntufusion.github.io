### Biography 

Dr. Chenguang Wan is a research fellow in the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences at Nanyang Technological University. Before joining NTU, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Plasma Physics, Chinese Academy Of Sciences (ASIPP) in China. He received his PhD in Physics from the University of Science and Technology of China in March 2023. 

### Research Interests 

Dr. Wan's work focuses on developing experiment and simulation data-driven models for tokamak. When it comes to simulation data, he primarily researches the plasma turbulence surrogate model. For experiment data-driven approaches, he concentrates on combining experimental data-driven models with tokamak control.
