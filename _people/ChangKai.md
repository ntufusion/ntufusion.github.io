### Biography 

Chai Chang Kai is currently enrolled in PhD studies in School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, of Nanyang Technological University (NTU), supervised by Professor Garbet. He obtained the degree of Bachelor of Sciences in Physics, with a second major in Mathematical Sciences, from NTU.

### Research Interests 

Chang Kai is working on electromagnetic stabilisation in magnetic confinement fusion. Fusion plasma has an extremely high temperature and is confined using electromagnetic fields. However, fluctuations in electromagnetic fields become inevitably one of the factors causing plasma instabilities. It turns out that destabilisation caused by electromagnetic fluctuations could occur when certain plasma parameters are at optimal value, which will, in turn, enhance the fusion power confinement in tokamak. Therefore, his project aims to investigate how electromagnetic instabilities behave in fusion plasma and are affected by different plasma parameters.
