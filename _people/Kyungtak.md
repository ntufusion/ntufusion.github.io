### Biography
Kyungtak Lim received a B.S. degree in Physics from Hanyang University, Korea, in 2015, an M.S. degree in Plasma Physics and Fusion (PPF) from Paris-Saclay University, France, in 2018, and a Ph.D. in Nuclear Fusion from Institut Jean Lamour (IJL), University of Lorraine, France, in 2021. Since 2021, he worked as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Swiss Plasma Center (SPC) at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland. In 2024, he joined the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (SPMS) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, as an Assistant Professor.

### Research Interests
Dr. Lim's main research focuses on the theoretical and numerical modeling of plasma turbulence in fusion devices, as well as the application of machine learning techniques to theoretical and experimental plasma physics.
