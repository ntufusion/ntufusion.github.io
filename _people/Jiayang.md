### Biography 

Jiayang Chen is currently a Ph.D. candidate at Dalian University of Technology. Since October 1, 2025, he has been a joint-training Ph.D. student at the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (SPMS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), where he will conduct research for two years. He received his Bachelor’s degree from Dalian University of Technology and continued directly into the Ph.D. program in the same institution.

### Research Interests 

During his Ph.D. studies at Dalian University of Technology, Jiayang has been working on:
- The interaction between tungsten fuzz and plasma in fusion devices, including its growth, erosion, heat transfer, and deuterium retention, using the SURO-FUZZ code developed by the team.
- Heat transfer and multiphase flow in porous media based on the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), implemented with a self-developed LBS code.

At NTU, his research will focus on:

- The impact of magnetic ripple on impurity transport in fusion devices, using the GYSELA code.
