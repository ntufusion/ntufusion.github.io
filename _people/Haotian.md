### Biography
Dr. Haotian Mao is a research fellow in the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences at Nanyang Technological University. He received his Ph.D. in Engineering Physics from the University of California, San Diego. Since April 2022, he has been a graduate researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory (Theoretical Division T-5), where his work focuses on high-Z pellet assimilation during disruption mitigation in tokamaks. His expertise includes particle-in-cell simulations of laser–plasma interactions and tokamak edge physics, with experience in incorporating atomic physics into plasma simulations.

### Research Interests
- Turbulence studies in tokamaks using the HERMES-3 simulation
- Edge and divertor physics, including plasma detachment and impurity transport 
- Plasma simulation tool development and advanced data analysis
 

### Awards
- UC-National Laboratory In-Residence Graduate Fellowships
