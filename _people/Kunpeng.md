### Biography 

Dr. Kunpeng Li is a research fellow in the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences and College of Computing and Data Science at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). He received the Ph.D. degree from the School of Mechanical Engineering from Dalian University of Technology (DUT) in June 2023. 

### Research Interests 

Dr. Liâ€™s work is focused on development of surrogate modeling algorithm, multi-source data fusion, shape-performance integrated digital twin, and engineering design optimization. Now he is working on the combination of machine learning and plasma turbulence based on the physics informed neural networks (PINNs), to assist the numerical simulations.
