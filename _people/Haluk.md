### Biography 

Haluk Sait Aksoy is enrolled in PhD studies at the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) under the supervision of Kyungtak Lim, starting in January 2026. He obtained a Bachelor of Science in Nuclear Engineering from UNIST, South Korea, and a Master of Science in Nuclear Fusion and Engineering Physics through the Erasmus Mundus FUSION-EP program in Europe.

### Research Interests 

Haluk’s research is focused on surrogate models. Understanding plasma dynamics is challenging due to nonlinear interactions across multiple time and length scales, requiring state-of-the-art high-performance computing (HPC) resources and significant computational time. His project aims to develop a reduced model, a physics informed neural network (PINN), that accelerates simulations while preserving essential physics, supporting the optimization of future fusion devices.
