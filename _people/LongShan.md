### Biography 

Chan Long Shan is a PhD student in the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (SPMS) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) from August 2025 onwards. He will be graduating as a bachelor majoring in physics with a minor in mathematics in July 2025 from NTU.

### Research Interests 

Long Shan is currently working on the effect of edge turbulence on the turbulence spreading in the SOL plasma. As the power width of ITER is predicted to be approximately 1mm (with average heat fluxes predicted to be at 150MW), it is important to find a way to widen the power width since the current materials available cannot withstand such high energy. However, at the edge region of plasma in fusion reactors, the turbulence propagates heat and particles fluxes radially outwards from the core plasma, resulting in power width spreading that is good for heat exhaust. There are many types of edge turbulence that could affect the diffusivity of the heat and particle fluxes. Therefore, his project is to account the effect of blobs (positive jet velocity of turbulence) towards the turbulence spreading.
