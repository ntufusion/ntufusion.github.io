### Biography 

Dr. Ameir Shaa is a research fellow in the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences at Nanyang Technological University. Prior to joining NTU, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at CNRS@CREATE in Singapore. He earned his PhD in High Energy Physics at CERN from the University of Alberta, Canada, in May 2023.

### Research Interests 

Dr. Ameir Shaaâ€™s work lies at the intersection of machine learning and plasma physics, leveraging data-driven techniques to uncover the underlying causes of unexplained phenomena. His primary focus is on developing surrogate models for plasma processes using simulation data, with the aim of applying these models to experimental data in real-time. Additionally, his research interests encompass quantum computing applications for plasma studies, proper orthogonal decomposition techniques, and urban wind field surrogate modeling.
