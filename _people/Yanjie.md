### Biography
Dr. Yanjie Zhang is a research fellow at the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences at Nanyang Technological University. He received his Ph.D. degree in Plasma Physics from Dalian University of Technology. Since December 2022, he has served as a visiting researcher at the ITER Organization (Science Division, Plasma Modelling & Analysis Section) in France, focusing on ITER limiter ramp-up phase simulations and SOLPS-ITER wide grid version tests. His expertise lies in using SOLPS-ITER to model edge and divertor plasma for tokamaks (e.g., HL-3/HL-2M) and linear devices (MPS-LD), with experience collaborating with simulation codes such as DIVIMP, BOUT++, and EMC3-EIRENE.

### Research Interests
- Plasma modeling using SOLPS-ITER for tokamaks (HL-3/HL-2M, ITER) and linear devices (MPS-LD) 
- Edge and divertor plasma mechanisms, including detachment and impurity transport 
- ITER limiter ramp-up phase simulation and SOLPS-ITER wide grid version testing 
- Radiative divertor studies with full drifts and impurity seeding effects 
- Development of simulation tools and data analysis packages for plasma research
 

### Awards
- National Scholarship for Doctoral Students
- Excellent Graduate of Liaoning Province
