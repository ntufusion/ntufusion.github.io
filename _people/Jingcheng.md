### Biography 

JingCheng Huang is currently enrolled in PhD studies in the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University (NTU). He obtained his Master’s degree from the same school at NTU. His research focuses on applying modern machine learning techniques to understand and extract underlying physical principles from complex systems.

### Research Interests 

JingCheng’s research lies at the intersection of physics and machine learning. He is particularly interested in utilizing data-driven and physics-informed machine learning methods to extract meaningful physical structures, conserved quantities, and governing mechanisms from high-dimensional and noisy physical data. His work aims to bridge the gap between black-box learning models and interpretable physical understanding, with applications to complex nonlinear systems.
