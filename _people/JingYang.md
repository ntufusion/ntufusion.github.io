### Biography 

Ng Jing Yang is a PhD student in the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). He obtained his bachelor's degree in physics with a minor in mathematics in 2023 from NTU.

### Research Interests 

Jing Yang is currently working on a project aimed to study the underlying mechanism of the self-regulation of turbulence driven by trapped electrons in a magnetised plasma. 
Zonal flows play a crucial role in regulating turbulence driven by trapped electrons when the temperature gradient is low while density gradient is large. 
However, it was shown that zonal flows are ineffective when the electron temperature gradient is large relative to the density gradient. 
Instead, the generation of “zonal density fields” was identified as the key self-regulation mechanism. 
The objective of this PhD work is to uncover the underlying mechanisms responsible for the turbulent generation of zonal density fields and feedback on transport. And then identify the key plasma parameters in order to optimise plasma confinement.
