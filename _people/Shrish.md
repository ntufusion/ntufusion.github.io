### Biography
Dr. Shrish Raj is a research fellow in the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences at Nanyang Technological University. 
He completed his PhD in July 2024 at the Institute for Plasma Research, a Constituent Institution of Homi Bhabha National Institute, Department of Atomic Energy, India.

### Research interests
Dr. Shrish Raj' research is focused on impurity transport in the edge and scrape-off layer (SOL) regions of tokamaks. 
His work spans from non-linear fluid simulations to the theoretical modeling of impurity transport. 
In addition, he served as a Visiting Researcher at the ITER Organization, France, from March 2023 to September 2023.

Currently, he is focused on utilizing gyrokinetic framework to investigate Toroidal Alfv√©n Eigenmodes (TAEs) driven by MeV energetic particles via self-consistent simulation. 
He is particularly interested in turbulence transport predictions in fusion plasmas, with a special emphasis on the dynamics of energetic particles.
