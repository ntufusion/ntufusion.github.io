## Assistant Professer in Theoretical and Computational Plasma Physics at NTU

Nanyang Technological University (NTU) seeks to appoint an Assistant Professors in Theoretical and Computational Plasma Physics, in the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (SPMS).

The holders will develop leading-edge research and build-up research activity in the field of fusion and plasma science for clean energy. They will work with the appointee to the Temasek Chair in Clean Energy to drive forward new research and teaching in the area of fusion science and technology, in collaboration with international partners.

Applicants must have a PhD in physics, mathematics, computer science or a related field, and show evidence of excellence in research, evidenced by indicators such as high-impact publications, the potential to obtain substantial grant support, and to develop their own research leadership. The successful candidates should demonstrate the potential to build a world-class research programme and a commitment to education and mentorship of students. They will be expected to build up, manage, and lead a pioneering research group, develop new collaborations with international teams, teach within SPMS, in particular in the area of fusion and plasma science, and contribute effectively to Singapore’s ambitions in future pathways to Clean Energy.

We seek applicants who, in particular, display significant research potential in the field of theoretical and computational plasma physics with focus on fusion energy.  They should have interests in magnetised plasma physics. A strong theoretical background in plasma physics with expertise in areas such as (but not limited to) kinetic or fluid modelling of magnetised plasmas, or data analysis in relation with fusion energy, or code validation and data analysis, is sought. Skills in using Artificial Intelligence methods for theory/experiment comparison may be helpful,  as Machine Learning and Deep Learning with neural networks may be beneficial. Thus, a demonstrated experience in high performance computing and acquaintance with applied maths and computer sciences is desirable.

Please contact Prof. Xaver Garbet (xavier.garbet@ntu.edu.sg) or Asst Prof. Zhisong Qu (zhisong.qu@ntu.edu.sg) if you have any questions.

<!-- Feel free to contact [our faculty members](/people/). -->

We will post our currently open positions here as soon as they become available. More are on the way!

## Ph.D Positions

We are looking for motivated PhD students to work in the area of theoretical and computational fusion plasma physics. These positions are fully funded and will be hosted in School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (SPMS), Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Please contact [our faculty members](/people/) if you are interested. 

Our main research area includes
- Accelerating wave and turbulence calculations
- Finding the optimal design of fusion devices
- Interpreting and compressing simulation/experimental data

Some of our projects are listed [here](/projects/). But please feel free to propose whatever you are interested in.

Applicants are expected to hold a Bachelor’s/Master’s degree in a related field by the time they start their PhD. Experience in one the following is desirable but not essential:
- Coursework or research undertaken in plasma physics.
- Running a high-performance supercomputer code, especially for fusion plasma physics.
- Using a modern machine learning software.

Please refer to the following websites for the minimum requirements and application guidelines of SPMS and NTU.
