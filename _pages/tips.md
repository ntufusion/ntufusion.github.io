Physical SIM cards are available in all terminals at Changi Airport from telco booths (Singtel, StarHub, M1, etc.), or at convenience stores (7-Eleven, Cheers, etc.) across the city. Tourist SIM cards come with data, local calls, and international minutes.

eSIMs are also available from local telco companies and can be purchased online.

### NTUGUEST Wi-Fi
When in NTU, you can connect to the NTUGUEST Wi-Fi by applying for an account via this [link](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/cits2/wireless/smsguide/smsguide.htm).

Please note that phone numbers used for such purpose will be tracked and recorded by NTU for auditing purposes.

## Other helpful information
### Laws and Regulations
Singapore is known for its strict laws. Some things to take note of:
- **No Littering**: Heavy fines are imposed for littering.
- **No Chewing Gum**: Importing and chewing gum is banned, except for medicinal purposes.
- **Drug Laws**: Singapore has very strict drug laws, including the death penalty for drug trafficking.
- **Smoking**: Smoking is prohibited in many public places, including parks, restaurants, and public transport. Be sure to smoke only in designated areas.
- **Public Behaviour**: Offensive behaviour, including spitting or public urination, can result in fines.

### Weather
Singaporeâ€™s climate is hot and humid year-round, so we recommend light and breathable clothing. However, most indoor areas are air-conditioned, so we also recommend bringing a light jacket for comfort. The region is also prone to thundershowers, so umbrellas may come in handy.
