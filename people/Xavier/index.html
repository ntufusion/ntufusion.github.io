<h3 id="biography">Biography</h3>
<p>Professor Xavier Garbet received a Batchelor’s degree in Physics from Paris Sorbonne University (France) in 1982, and a Master’s degree in plasma physics from Paris-Saclay University (France). He received a PhD degree in theoretical physics and high energy physics in 1988, and the Habilitation to conduct researches (HdR) in 2001 from Aix-Marseille University (France). Xavier Garbet is a fellow of the Ecole Normale Superieure Paris (1981 science). Xavier Garbet was hired by the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) in 1988, and became Research Director at CEA in 2008. He was visiting scientist at General Atomics (San Diego, USA) from 1994 to 1995, and led the Task Force Transport at JET (Joint European Torus, United Kingdom) from 2001 to 2004.  He joined the Division of Physics and Applied Physics, School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, NTU in 2022, where he holds the Temasek chair in Clean Energy as Professor of Theoretical and Computational Plasma Physics.</p>
