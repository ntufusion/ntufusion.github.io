Energetic particles play an important role in magnetically confined fusion plasmas, not only as a key channel for plasma heating and current drive, but also through their nonlinear interaction with microturbulence and meso-scale fluctuations. In reactor-relevant regimes, these interactions can significantly modify turbulent transport and, under certain conditions, contribute to turbulence suppression and improved confinement.

The main goal of this project is to improve the physics understanding of energetic-particle effects on plasma turbulence and transport using first-principles gyrokinetic modelling. In particular, the project will use the GYSELA code to investigate how energetic particle populations interact with turbulent fluctuations, zonal flows, and collective modes, and how these processes affect transport levels, turbulence saturation, and confinement properties across different plasma conditions and magnetic geometries.
