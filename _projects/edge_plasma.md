Edge plasma turbulence is a key issue in magnetically confined fusion plasmas because it strongly affects cross-field transport, heat and particle exhaust, and overall confinement. Predictive modeling of turbulence in the edge and scrape-off layer (SOL) is therefore essential for reactor-relevant conditions.

This project aims to improve the physics understanding of edge plasma turbulence using three-dimensional fluid modeling and systematic analysis of transport mechanisms. It will investigate how turbulence, collisionality, magnetic configuration, and boundary conditions shape fluctuation dynamics, particle and heat transport, and profile formation in the edge/SOL region.

Below are the possible interesting topics to address within our NTU fusion group:

- Boundyar plasma turbulence
- Effects of alternative divertor configurations (ADCs)
- Plasma detachment and exhuast physics
- Impurity transport in edge/SOL plasmas
- Blob dynamics and intermittent transport
- Plasma-neutral interactions
- Magnetic ripple/RMP effects on edge and divertor transport
- Validation of fluid/turbulence models against experimental data
- Reduced modeling and scaling laws for edge and divertor physics
- Surrogate AI modeling for fast prediction of edge/divertor plasma behavior and transport trends
